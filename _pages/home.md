Hello! My name is Zi Wang, and I am a PhD candidate from [Dept. of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at MIT](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/). I am a member of the [Learning & Intelligent Systems Group](http://lis.csail.mit.edu/new/) at [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) and the [Machine Learning Group](http://ml.mit.edu/) at MIT. I am working with [Prof. Stefanie Jegelka](http://people.csail.mit.edu/stefje/), [Prof. Leslie Pack Kaelbling](http://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/), and [Prof. Tomás Lozano-Pérez](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/) on Human Intelligence Assisted Artificial Intelligence (HIAAI), Bayesian optimization, active learning and integrated learning and planning for robots. See two of my project descriptions [here](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/bayesian-optimization-global-optimization-expensive-black-box-functions) and [here](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/active-learning-models-planning).
