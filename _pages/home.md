Hello! My name is Zi Wang, and I am a PhD candidate from [Dept. of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at MIT](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/). I am a member of the [Learning & Intelligent Systems Group](http://lis.csail.mit.edu/new/) at [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) and the [Machine Learning Group](http://ml.mit.edu/) at MIT. I am working closely with [Prof. Stefanie Jegelka](http://people.csail.mit.edu/stefje/), [Prof. Leslie Pack Kaelbling](http://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/) and [Prof. Tomás Lozano-Pérez](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/) on Human Intelligence Assisted Artificial Intelligence (HIAAI), Bayesian optimization, active learning and integrated learning and planning for robots. See two of my project descriptions [here](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/bayesian-optimization-global-optimization-expensive-black-box-functions) and [here](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/active-learning-models-planning). I will start a research intern position at [Microsoft Research New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/) working on the foundations and theories of HIAAI and [AutoML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/all-about-automated-machine-learning-with-dr-nicolo-fusi/) in the summer of 2019.
