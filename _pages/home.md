Hello! My name is Zi Wang, and I am a PhD candidate from [Dept. of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at MIT](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/). I am a member of the [Learning & Intelligent Systems Group](http://lis.csail.mit.edu/new/) at [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) and the [Machine Learning Group](http://ml.mit.edu/) at MIT. I am working closely with [Prof. Stefanie Jegelka](http://people.csail.mit.edu/stefje/), [Prof. Leslie Pack Kaelbling](http://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/) and [Prof. Tomás Lozano-Pérez](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/) on Human Intelligence Assisted Artificial Intelligence (HIAAI), Bayesian optimization, active learning and integrated learning and planning for robots. See two of my project descriptions [here](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/bayesian-optimization-global-optimization-expensive-black-box-functions) and [here](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/active-learning-models-planning). I will start a research intern position at [Microsoft Research New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/) working on the foundations and theories of HIAAI and [AutoML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/all-about-automated-machine-learning-with-dr-nicolo-fusi/) in the summer of 2019.

### My Favorite Life Achievements
- [Sep 2019] My mentee, Victoria, successfully submitted [her first paper to a machine learning conference, ICLR](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJxsV2R5FQ) with the help of our collaborators and our joint advisor, Leslie. This was the first time a UROP or MEng student who worked with me had the courage to continue doing research on one of the hardest problems in AI/ML/Robotics and eventually wrap up her work into a paper. This was one of the most gratifying moments in my PhD career and I sincerely hope there will be more couragous students working with me in the future.
- [May 2018] I [answered some questions on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Zi-Wang-21) and later became a "Most Viewed Writer in Machine Learning/AI/Computer Science/MIT ". One of my answers somehow got more than 330k views and 2k upvotes: ["Is Machine Learning just glorified statistics?"](https://qr.ae/TW7Py6). It helped me to be more aware of and think more deeply about the role of social media in the new era of science and education.
- [Sep 2017] [I got married to the most wonderful guy in the world!](http://zwyls.com/)
- [Spring 2017] I was on the Graduate Focus Group for the 2017 EECS Visiting Committee. We successfully put together a report on the pressing issues at our department, including my topics on the support for international graduate students in terms of practical training (starting from 2016, international students from EECS can no longer use Curriculum Practical Training (CPT) for internships), career development, and mental health issues. Our department was able to swiftly respond to the CPT problem and implemented solutions to our PhD degree requirements in 2018 to meet [the regulations set by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)](https://www.ice.gov/sevis/practical-training).
- [May 2017] I successfully argued back about $5000 tax mispayment to the IRS, with advice from my law school friend, self-education on the tax laws and treaties, and patience to the long calls to the IRS. 
- [Feb 2017] I successfully [finished two papers on time and submitted to ICML 17 with collaborators](https://ziw.mit.edu/publications/#2017). It was quite a lot of work but at the same time gratifying. 
- [Apr 2016] I did [my first long oral presentation (20 min)](https://ziw.mit.edu/publications/#2016) at a machine learning conference, AISTATS 16, at a beautiful town in Spain called Cádiz. I went on a trip to Barcelona and Madrid afterwards with a friend and we enjoyed a lot of great sangria and all kinds of paella. 
- [Feb 2014] I successfully got my first paid job at USC working with [Prof. Fei Sha](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~feisha/), after an exchange program at USC in the summer of 2013. 
- [Dec 2013] I went to my first machine learning conference, NIPS'13 (now NeurIPS), to present a collaborated project supervised by [Prof. Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/) at Tsinghua University. I also rented a car and went on a road trip to Las Vegas and Los Angeles afterwards with my friend. Good old days.

If you have generic questions about my research on Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, having a life at competitive graduate schools like MIT, advisor-advisee relationships or mental health issues, and you feel like an answer to those can also benefit other people, please consider [posting a question on Quora and notify me about it via email and/or a Quora request](https://www.quora.com/profile/Zi-Wang-21). 

If you want my short comments on the issues similar to the topics listed above, please consider [tweeting to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziwphd). I highly recommend this method because you may be able to get a slightly faster response.

If I don’t reply to your email in 5 days, it’s likely my MIT email is having trouble again on filtering. So maybe send another one, or send an email to my friends instead, or write me a physical letter or postcard (32 Vassar St. 32-G414, Cambridge, MA 02139), or find me at free food events at MIT.
