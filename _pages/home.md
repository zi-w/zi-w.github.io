Hello! I am a Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind, and a Visiting Lecturer at Harvard University. My research is driven by the pursuit of intelligent decision-making, with a current emphasis on understanding and improving the alignment between human judgments and Bayesian beliefs of AI systems. Examples:

Understanding AI models via
- [Gaussian process probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18213),
- [belief states of text-to-image agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06771).

Improving AI's belief alignment to humans by

- [pre-training Gaussian processes to align with expert beliefs](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/04/pre-trained-gaussian-processes-for.html),
- proactively gathering information from humans in [image generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06771) and [reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22674) tasks.

My prior experiences are in machine learning and robot learning, including Bayesian optimization, learning for task and motion planning, active learning, and Gaussian processes. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT, advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/) and [Tomás Lozano-Pérez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/). I received my S.M. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, advised by [Stefanie Jegelka](https://people.csail.mit.edu/stefje/index.html) and [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/).
