Hello! I am a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind. My research is motivated by intelligent decision making, and currently focuses on [understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18213) and [improving](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/04/pre-trained-gaussian-processes-for.html) the alignment between human judgements and Bayesian beliefs in AI systems.

My prior experiences are in machine learning and robotics, including Bayesian optimization, learning for task and motion planning, active learning, and Gaussian processes. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT, advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/) and [Tomás Lozano-Pérez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/). I received my S.M. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, advised by [Stefanie Jegelka](https://people.csail.mit.edu/stefje/index.html) and [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/).

We are hiring a student researcher on topics related to uncertainty-aware decision making for LLMs and/or text-to-image models in 2024. [Click here for more information.](https://ziw.mit.edu/pub/srp.pdf)
